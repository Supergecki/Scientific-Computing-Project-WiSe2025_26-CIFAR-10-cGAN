IMPORTANT RULES FOR CONTRIBUTING:

- This repository's language is English. Keep all documentation, issues, commit messages etc. in English.
- EVERYTHING has to be documented, i.e. the documentation has to be kept complete and up to date, code has to be commented thoroughly and all problems should be put into an Issue. All Commits/Pull Requests have to be linked to EXACTLY ONE specific Issue.
- Create a new branch for each Issue that is deleted after resolving the Issue (i.e. merging the Pull Request) --> No direct Commits on main, only via Pull Requests coming from development branches!
- Code has to be tested thoroughly before being merged or pushed _anywhere_ into the repository.
- Pull Requests should only be merged after being reviewed by another collaborator.
- Don't check in ANY binary or build files into the repository. This includes (but is not limited to) trained models (including checkpoints), training logs, images and plots.
